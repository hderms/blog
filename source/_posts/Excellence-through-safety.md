title: Excellence through safety

Every business wants teams that excel. Mountains of literature has been written on how to build and maintain teams. Countless people are employed for this purpose. But have we cracked the code? Ignoring, for a moment, the impossibility of guaranteeing steps for success for something as messy as groups of people interacting together to accomplish somewhat ill-defined tasks, there must be some steps one can take to at least increase the chance of success. But first we'd have to figure out what it means by success.

## Successful teams
A successful team must be viewed, at least partially, as separate from the projects they undertake. Some projects are doomed from the start, and others are so easy as to be almost guaranteed.

The success of a team can be thought of as an independent quantity. And I'm a firm believer in the research Google did which found they could measure the success of a team using one particular characteristic: [psychological safety](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html?_r=0). In order to  keep a team running smoothly, it all starts with trust. Team members need to test their leaders. Team members need to trust each other. And to top it all off: team members must trust the psychology of the culture you've developed. Why do teachers make such a big point of driving home the idea that "there are no dumb questions"? It's because true learning doesn't start until you are ready to admit all the things you do not know, and to be able to innocently ask questions or hypothesize.

Figuring out solutions to problems isn't a simple linear process. While it would be nice if we could write down the scientific method on a piece of paper and just consult it whenever we realize we don't understand how bug #992123 managed to cause 50% of your customers to lose their billing data. You'd just do the following:
1. State your problem
2. Construct a hypothesis
3. Test it with an experiment
4. Repeat

What complicates things is that number 2 is not as simple as a single step would make you assume. Constructing valid explanations for a bug, to continue with the example, in a team environment can be extremely complicated. It can be like a breadth-first search, like a depth-first search, like genetic algorithms, etc... It's fundamentally a search through the hypothesis-space with some shortcut heuristics thrown in. When you get a good team together that isn't afraid of making wild guesses, and can constructively eliminate wild guesses without fear or insult, you have the ability to search that space so much more efficiently.

## How do we build up psychological safety?
### Listening
Before someone will feel confident participating in the kind of fruitful discussions mentioned previously, they have to trust they will be heard. No one wants to talk to a brick wall. Therefore, we have to encourage a culture of active listening. Do not ignore someone's suggestion simply because of hierarchy. Don't spend the entire time you should be listening thinking about what your next idea is. Engineers have a tendency to get tunnel vision, so this can be mediated by writing down ideas rapidly without digging deeply into them until later, leading people to be able to get their ideas out without anyone losing their train of thought.

### Giving credit where credit is due
People love to be valued for their contributions, hate to see someone mistakenly valued for something that they themselves did, and absolutely hate to be falsely represented or misunderstood. It's not easy to encourage these behaviors short of making sure you yourself always give people credit when it is due. Most of the time this is a hiring issue as good employees are unlikely to try 'stealing' credit.

### Praise in public, reprimand in private
No one wants to get a bad reputation with their coworkers, so avoid giving them one they can't get rid of. Ideas should stand on their own as much as possible, so don't bias people by developing a culture of public criticism of each other.

## How do we make use of our new found safety?
### Actively encourage speculation
Most problems have more than one solution. Most facts have more than one proof. It helps to keep this in mind when involving your team in discussions, and an easy way to cement this is to informally never proceed on testing a hypothesis or materializing a design until more than one suggestion has been recorded. In the interests of expediency, small groups will often move in a depth-first search approach and immediately start trying to prove something as soon as its suggested. While this often works, it is an interesting thought experiment to imagine a world where we never acted until we had considered more than one possibility.
#### Breadth First Search
This tool, when translated to group discussions goes hand in hand with brainstorming. We mention lots of possibilities quickly without investigating them further in an attempt to explore as much of the space as possible before biasing ourselves towards a certain path. The rule reads as follows: "List two before investigating one", meaning, you should have at least two possible explanations before going further on one.
